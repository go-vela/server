## Pull Requests

**NOTE: We recommend you start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on.**

We are always open to new PRs! You can follow the below guide for learning how you can contribute to the project!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Review the commit guide we follow](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) - ensure your commits follow our standards
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) - building block for local development
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - start up local development
* [Github OAuth Client](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) - building block for local Development
* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) - for source code and [dependency management](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
* _optional but recommended_ [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - start up local development

### Setup

* [Fork](/fork) this repository

* Clone this repository to your workstation:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:go-vela/server.git $HOME/go-vela/server
```

* Navigate to the repository code:

```bash
# Change into the project directory
cd $HOME/go-vela/server
```

* Point the original code at your fork:

```bash
# Add a remote branch pointing to your fork
git remote add fork https://github.com/your_fork/server
```

* Create [OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) and obtain secrets for local development:
  * Homepage URL = `<url of api server>`
  * Authorization callback URL = `<url of web ui>/account/authenticate`

**NOTE: This will work for GitHub or GitHub Enterprise.**

```bash
# Add Github Client ID to local secrets file for `docker-compose`
echo "VELA_SOURCE_CLIENT=<Github Client ID>" >> secrets.env

# Add Github Client Secret to local secrets file for `docker-compose`
echo "VELA_SOURCE_SECRET=<Github Client Secret>" >> secrets.env
```

### Running Locally
